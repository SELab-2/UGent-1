\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the PigeonHole Ugent Submission Platform User Manual. This manual provides instructions for users, teachers, and administrators on how to effectively use the platform, step by step. The platform is designed to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and providing feedback on projects. It seeks to create a middle ground between being easy to use but also providing the necessary features for automatic feedback on big projects. As for now we only support UGent accounts to use the platform.

\section{Getting Started}
\subsection{Creating an Account}
Users can only login with their UGent account. If you do not have an account, please contact the administrator to create one for you.

\subsection{Logging In}
When acessing the platform, students will be prompted to log in with their UGent account. UGent uses OAuth2 for authentication, so you will be redirected to the UGent login page. After logging in, you will be redirected back to the platform.
