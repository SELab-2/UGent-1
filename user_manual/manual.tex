\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the PigeonHole Ugent Submission Platform User Manual. This manual provides instructions for users, teachers, and administrators on how to effectively use the platform, step by step. The platform is designed to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and providing feedback on projects. It seeks to create a middle ground between being easy to use but also providing the necessary features for automatic feedback on big projects. As for now we only support UGent accounts to use the platform.
